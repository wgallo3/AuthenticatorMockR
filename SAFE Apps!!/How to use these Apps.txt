Hi! Glad you're trying out the new SAFE Authenticator Browser with offline Mock-Routing!

These are all the apps that are built to work with Authenticator so far. Only these 3.

I haven't been able to get any of them to work as expected yet, but if you want to have a go, there are instructions in each folder's README.md that you can open with a text editor and read and try.

I already did the "npm install" part so if you're comfortable with command line, you should just be able to "cd" into each folder and try "npm start" on each one. 

If that doesn't work, use the instructions in the README.md 's. Enjoy!
